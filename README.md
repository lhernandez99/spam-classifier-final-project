# spam-classifier-final-project
CSCA 5622 Final Project: Supervised Learning with Spam Classification
This project is a supervised learning classification task that predicts whether a message is spam or ham using the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset.

## Problem Statement
Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify SMS messages into "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, TF-IDF)
- Supervised Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance)
